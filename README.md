# books2web

A very simple javascript library to read a list of books and allow a user to browse and search them.

## Purpose

This was primarily made to have a web-based way to browse a personal library card catalogue that was generated by the
[My Library Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vgm.mylibrary).  However, it only reads a very generic
JSON-based data set, which could be generated from other sources as well.


## Getting data from My Library app

1. Export as Excel to `MyLibrary.xls`

2. Run `MyLibrary2json.pl > books.json`


## Styling

Example css and html files are included, but are intended to be adjusted to meet a users tastes.  An empty `<table>` element is all that is needed, to be
populated with the library data.

## JSON structure

`books.json` should contain 2 top-level keys: `keys` and `data`, both of which reference arrays.

* `keys` contains the "header" (property) names of each row of data, e.g. `["title", "author", ...]`
* `data` is an array of arrays, where each row is the book data, with element orders corresponding to the properies from `keys`

_This is format of the output generated by `MyLibrary2json.pl` when using `MyLibrary.xls` as exported from the My Library app._

**Example:**

```
{
   "keys" : [
      "Title",
      "Authors",
      "ISBN"
   ],

   "data" : [
      [
         "A Book Worth Reading",
         "Some Author",
         "00000000000"
      ],
      [
         "From My Library",
         "A. Writer, Anne Illustrator",
         "1111111111111"
      ],
      ...
   ]
}
```
